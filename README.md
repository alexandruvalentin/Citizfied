## UX

### __Business Goals__

  To build an application that:
-   offers people the chance to rate and review any city in any country in the world based on their own experience.
-   allows the visitors to read reviews of places they would like to visit.
-	stands as an online places-to-visit guide based on its users reviews.

### __Customer Goals__

-	Learn about places they would like to visit from reviews uploaded by other human beings.
-	Create their own account which they can use to submit reviews to any city they have visited.
-	Manage their submitted reviews via an account panel.
-   Look up reviews using a search engine.

### __Scope__

* __Functional requirements:__

    -  Option to easily navigate through the pages and content;
    -  Option to search the web for desired meals/recipes;
    -  Option to view social media accounts;
    -  Option to submit queries/recipes via contact form;

* __Content requirements:__

    -	Compelling content that communicates the purpose of the website;
    -	Content flexibility for easier scanning;
    -	Mixed media content for easy understanding of concepts presented;
    -	Various CTAs;

### __User Stories__

-	Subtle visual feedback will be added throughout the page in order to increase the user's interaction experience;
2.	Information architecture:
-	The content is organised in order of importance, from top to bottom and left to right
